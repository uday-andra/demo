    <h2>My name is UDAY CHANDRA. <br> I recently completed my B.Tech in the stream of Information Technology from Pace Institute of Technology and Sciences. <br>
I'm the person who believes in continuous learning and improvement. During my four years of engineering, I not only focused on academics but also developed a keen interest in web designing, ethical hacking and also create attractive Power BI dashboards. 
I worked on few mini-projects, including Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) project from Cyber security, which helped me understand real-world problem-solving.
Apart from technical skills, I also had actively involved in Srujana event in my college, which improved my teamwork and leadership abilities.I enjoy taking on challenges and see them as opportunities to grow.
My strengths include a positive attitude, Self motivated and Dedication..</h2>
